ShoppingCart
============
This project was made by me at the request of the Power To Fly team as a "code check".

I used JavaScript and the Jasmine testing suite.

To use the application, clone the repository and open the shoppingCart.html file in your browser.  You should see the application as well as the test suite showing 7 passing tests.  If you click on the apple or the orange, it will be added to your shopping cart.  If you click on the "special offers" tag, two buttons appear as well as text asking you to choose a special offer.  When you choose an offer, that offer will be applied to your order when you click on the "checkout" button.  If no special offer is chosen, when you click the "checkout" button, your order will be calculated with the prices shown below the apple and orange, $0.60 and $0.25 respectively.
